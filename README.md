# VSDIAT RISC-V Tapeout Journey 🚀

This repository documents my learning and progress through the **VSDIAT RISC-V Tapeout program**.  
Each week’s work, exercises, and notes are organized into separate folders for easy navigation.

📂 **Structure**  
- `WEEK-0/` → Getting started with the environment and basic setup  
- `WEEK-1/` → Initial design tasks and Verilog practice  
- More weeks will be added as I progress 🚧  

📝 **How to Use**  
- Navigate into each weekly folder to find the **README.md** and related files.  
- Screenshots, code snippets, and design outputs are included for reference.  

💡 Stay tuned for updates as I continue the RISC-V tapeout journey!
